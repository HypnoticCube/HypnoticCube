- Hi, We're @HypnoticCube, collectively known as Cube.
- We're interested in various things like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, Tears of Themis, Pony Town, etc.
- We're currently learning Norwegian!
- You can reach us by Discord: hypnoticcube
- Collective Pronouns: They/It/Xe
- Little disclaimer: We're a slow responder, and we swear we don't mean to ignore you.
- IMPORTANT!! we are a Dissociative Identity Disorder System, called The Council System. Doubles are 100% welcome! 
- We barely check GitHub (so so sorry, but we do from time to time!)
